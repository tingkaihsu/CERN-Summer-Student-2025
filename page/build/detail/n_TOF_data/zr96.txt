# Zr96 Maxwellian-Averaged Cross Sections (MACS)
# Comment2 : <br>At higher energies (above 25keV), the Direct Radiative Capture (DRC) results become increasingly sensitive to the choice of the potential V0, which leads also to large uncertainties in the DRC contributions.<br>PLease refer to the n_TOF reference for more details.
